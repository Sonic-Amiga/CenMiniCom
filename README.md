# Schematics for the Centurion Minicomputer replica

This is my work in progress repository, documenting an attempt to build a replica of a
Centurion minicomputer. The repository is a fork of Meisaka's reverse engineering project
(https://github.com/Meisaka/CenMiniCom.git) and contains some modifications.

#### IMPORTANT: Schematics are originally reverse engineered from multiple hi-res images of the various cards, so they may contain mistakes or errors.

# Modifications list.

1. 256x8 opcode table ROM is replaced by 2x256x4
2. Some old and hard-to-find chips are replaced with easier to find analogs.
Since i live in Russia some or these replacements are Soviet/Russian clones of
original chips.

Russian characters in this file are using "ANSI" AKA Windows-1251 character set.
