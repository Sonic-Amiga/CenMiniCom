# Schematics for the Centurion Minicomputer replica

This is my work in progress repository, documenting an attempt to build a replica of a
Centurion minicomputer. The repository is a fork of Meisaka's reverse engineering project
(https://github.com/Meisaka/CenMiniCom.git) and contains some modifications.

This is a rather complex project, consisting of a multiple boards. For more information about
boards, which have actually been worked on, please see a README.md file in corresponding board's
subdirectory.

#### IMPORTANT: Schematics are originally reverse engineered from multiple hi-res images of the various cards, so they may contain mistakes or errors.
